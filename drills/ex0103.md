After typing '#' into the first line and running ex0103.py, the first line of

Looking it up reveals that the octothorpe is a symbol denoting a comment, a
command telling the Python interpreter to ignore the affected line of code.

## Main takeaways
* \# tells the python interpreter to ignore the line of code preceding it.
* \# is used to disable pieces of code and act as places where programmer can
leave notes, messages, and commentary for helpful clarifications.
